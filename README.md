# Theory of Finite Element Analysis

### This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook file I wrote for my MECH.5130 - Theory of Finite Element Analysis class, which I took in my senior year at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. 

Moreover, this is the file I used for my final! You can see the question numbers and the code output, although I do not have the questions' text anymore :cry:.
Only a few questions required code, others were hand calculated or calculated using FEA sowftware such as Abaqus.

But still! This is a Finite Element Analysis Module that can calculate element characteristics, such as stress, strain, displacement, and shape function!

Go in and have a look for yourself! The graphs were the best part about this class :joy: :grin:
